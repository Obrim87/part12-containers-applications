    # Requests starting with /api/ are handled
    # The proxy_pass directive has an interesting feature with a trailing slash. As we are using the path /api for location but the backend application only answers in paths / or /todos we will want the /api to be removed from the request. In other words, even though the browser will send a GET request to /api/todos/1 we want the Nginx to proxy the request to /todos/1. Do this by adding a trailing slash / to the URL at the end of **proxy_pass**.
